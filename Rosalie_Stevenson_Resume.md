#### 3/1/20-Current
Back-end Java engineer on a team that runs the ETL process on MongoDB and Postgres source databases.
- Optimized a asynchronous newly developed program to mitigate ticket intake and speed of "connector" (ETL process). Reduced both ticket numbers and speed of connector by 1/3.
- Developed a feature that allowed users to enable a real-time cursor on MongoDB databases, reducing speed of sync by a quarter.
- Led tech interviews for customer support engineers and software development engineers.
- Worked on cross-functional teams through the organization to optimize the speed of connectors universally, sharing knowledge of Java profiling and asynchronization with several members of the staff.
- Maintained unit tests and integration tests, creating a script that allowed these tests to integrate with docker.

### Adobe - Software Developer

Back-end software engineer on a sub-team that creates scheduled and immediate asynchronous server processes, maintains data storage, and integrates and normalizes data stored by other sub teams for first and third party partners. 
- Wrote several RESTful APIs within a SPRING powered framework to query and format data, then surfaced by our systems user interface.
- Debugged and created a code fix for a race condition that had been surfaced within our generic scheduling library.
- Contributed to and wrote several asynchronous scheduled processes to support data collection.
- Debugged, reformatted, and rebuilt MySQL queries to better service run-time.
- Built a generic library within our system that used Java reflection and object handling to create an OutputStream to be written to a file. 
- Worked on a team that was concurrently transitioning into using Docker and Kubernetes to support CI/CD.

### Adobe - Software Engineer in Test
#### 1/1/17-7/1/18
Performed manual and automated testing for the PTV team.
